Use a public Pokemon API to display relevant information on a front-end application.

## Goal

Create a front-end application to display relevant information fetched from a Pokemon API. The API is the public [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

### First Step

From a blank page, I want to be able to search a Pokemon by its number.

A successful search should display some relevant information about it (like the Pokemon name, its picture and its type).

An user input error (like an unexisting number) should be handled properly.

### Next Steps Suggestions

I want to be able to search for multiple Pokemon by their name. As soon as 3 characters are input, a list of Pokemon chose name includes the input is shown.

I want to improve my application performances by using a cache system. We assume Pokemon never change, so once a Pokemon has been fetched, we should never request it on the API anymore.

I want to add end-to-end tests to this application.

## Implementation Help

- Use any frontend framework you're comfortble with.
- Feel free to use any existing relevant library.
- Take some time to understand the API.

## Some Evaluation Points

- classes and types benefits
- unit tests
- tools usage like CLI and IDE
- discussions around the business requirements and the technical implementation
- usage of Git
